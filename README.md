i regret that this is not finished.  it's unstable but you can use it if you want ig

should you choose to accept it, there are bad instructions at the top of src/lib.rs

(but the "WebSocket handler 2" has yet to be implemented so don't worry about it.  pretend like it doesn't exist)

there are only 2 functions you need to worry about

i think i'll make them macros at some point because it's a lot to type

you can find an example here: https://github.com/munvoseli/aaaaa/blob/master/src/main.rs#L90
